# Dyslexi-a-pp
An interactive learning application for children suffering from Dyslexia

Our project is related to a specific learning disability in children, Dyslexia. First,
we need to know what is Dyslexia. Dyslexia is a specific learning disability in
reading. Kids with Dyslexia have trouble reading accurately and 
uently. They may also have trouble with reading comprehension, spelling and writing. It is a
lifelong condition that makes it difficult for people to read. Its the most common
learning issue, although its not clear what percentage of kids have it. Some experts
believe the number is between 5 and 10 percent. Others say as many as 17 percent
of people show signs of reading issues.
Dyslexia is mainly a problem with reading accurately and fluently. Kids with Dyslexia may have trouble answering questions about something they have read.
But when its read to them, they may have no difficulty at all. Dyslexia impacts
people in varying degrees, so symptoms may differ from one child to another.
Generally, symptoms show up as problems with accuracy and fluency in reading
and spelling.

A key sign of Dyslexia in kids is trouble in decoding words. This is the ability
to match letters to sounds and then use that skill to read words accurately and
fluently. One reason kids have diculty decoding is that they often struggle with
a more basic language skill called phonemic awareness. This is the ability to
recognize individual sounds in words. Trouble with this skill can show up as
early as preschool. If a child has Dyslexia, she/he wont outgrow it. But there
are supports, teaching approaches and strategies to help her/his overcome her
challenges.

The aim is to develop an interactive learning application (Android) for children
suering from Dyslexia. This application should inculcate proper approaches and
strategies in order to help the child overcome the challenges faced in reading and
writing text. At the same time, it should be more interactive, for instance, it
may have an interface similar to that of a game so that the child wont get bored.
Interactive exercises will be given where the child will be asked to write a given
word/sentence within the stipulated amount of time. The application should be
intelligent enough to filter out the words with which the child is facing more
diculty and use these words more frequently in subsequent phases, in order to
make the child get comfortable with that word, thus overcoming the difficulty.
The app has n levels of difficulty, say 1, 2, 3,., n where level 1 contains words
and the associated sentences of least difficulty ( simple words and sentences). As
the level increases, the user will be given more difficult words (in the sense, which
are lengthy or difficult to pronounce or relatively newer words) and sentences. If
the user makes a mistake writing a particular word, that word should be given
frequently in the future till he/she gets familiar with that word/sentences. In this
way, the user gets a complete learning experience.

Most of the interactive learning apps on Google play-store are not available for
free, which is not affordable by all. And there are very few apps which focus on
combating the challenges faced by children suffering from Dyslexia. Keeping these
two things in mind, our focus was clear - to develop an interactive learning app
(Android) for children suffering from Dyslexia, which is free of cost. Apart from the
support given by parents and teachers, these kind of applications will encourage
independent reading for students with language related learning disabilities. The
only requirement is a Android smart-phone, which is now very much accessible
and feasible. Smart-phones are cheaper and more cost efficient nowadays, thus
becoming a household commodity in this generation.
